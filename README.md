### Recommendations
---
- More focus should be given to the highest profit generating indicators: Kansas state; Billboard campaign type (more profit came from this, even though it has the lowest count when compared to the other 3 campaign types); Online store, Sportwear and Beauty related products, Low-Middle income group, married, bachelor’s degree holders and 35-45 age group;
- The Company should collect data as to reason for its customers churn;
- The absence of churn reasons in the entire 5 tables deprived us the opportunity to know the reason behind each customer’s churn;
- Knowing the reason behind each customer’s churn would allow us know the major churn reason and advise the Company to work duly on the reason.

### Limitations
---
- Only 3 tables were utilized for the analysis and visualizations:
  - Product_Analytics (PA);
  - Customer_Data_Enriched 1;
  - Marketing
- The Operations and Financial tables were not utilized for the analysis and visualizations.
- The profit column used is that of the PA table – covering only from April 2024 through April 2025 (a year profit).
- The Financial table has a profit column spanning from January 2020 through December 2023 – the Product_Ids that generated the recorded profits here do not bear any correlation with the Product_Ids that generated the profits recorded on the PA table.
- Hence the reason for utilizing the PA, as it is more detailed than the Financials table.
- There are empty cells (missing customer_ids) after Customer_Id 50001 (cell reference: L49003).
- We deleted all those empty cells, to preserve the accuracy of my results/findings.
